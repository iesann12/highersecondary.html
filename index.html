        +2 Programme in Science Stream
    </div>
   
   

   
    <p>
        The +2 curriculum is the pathway to further education for post SEE (or equivalent level) students.
        The curriculum offers an in-depth study of different subjects to meet the objectives of high school
        education. Its structure–credit hour, curriculum, examinations –makes the programmes one of the most 
        relevant educational qualifications in Nepal.
    </p>
    <p>
        The programme is constantly upgraded by different subject committees in CDC by keeping in mind the
        ever-changing international education standards. This helps in maintaining the quality of +2 education.
        Due to this, the demand of our national curriculum is high.
    </p>
    <p>
        The two-year +2 curriculum is an academically challenging period. These young scholars need to be motivated
        and should focus upon set goals. This results in student satisfaction and continuing interest in education.
